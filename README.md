*Customer Churn Prediction with Python*

This repository provides Python code for building a machine learning model to predict customer churn in a telecommunications dataset (assuming the dataset is named "Churn_Modelling.csv"). It utilizes various techniques, including:

- Data exploration and visualization
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Feature engineering
- Class imbalance handling with SMOTE
- Feature selection with RFE
- Hyperparameter tuning with GridSearchCV
- Model evaluation with classification report, accuracy, ROC AUC score, and confusion matrix
- Feature importance analysis (placeholder for future implementation)

**Prerequisites**

- Python 3.x (ensure compatibility with your specific libraries)
- Essential libraries:
    - pandas
    - numpy
    - seaborn
    - matplotlib
    - scikit-learn
    - imblearn
    - missingno (optional)
    - shap (optional, for feature importance)


**Expected Output**

The script will:

- Display descriptive statistics of the dataset
- Visualize the churn distribution and feature correlations
- Perform feature engineering (e.g., AverageBalance)
- Handle class imbalance using SMOTE
- Standardize features
- Run K-Fold Cross-Validation with various models and report their performance
- Perform feature selection (optional)
- Perform hyperparameter tuning (optional)
- Train a model (Random Forest by default) and evaluate its performance
- Generate a confusion matrix

**Further Enhancements**

- Consider using a more robust feature importance analysis technique, such as SHAP or LIME (placeholder in the code).
- Explore additional feature engineering techniques based on domain knowledge.
- Experiment with different machine learning algorithms and compare their performance.
- Implement model persistence to save and load trained models.
- Create a web application or API to deploy the model for real-time predictions.
